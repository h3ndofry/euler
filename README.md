# Euler - Solution 18

You'll want to install [Bun](https://bun.sh).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun start
```

It'll run on `localhost:3000`. Once you're done cooking with `bun`, just hit `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` on your terminal to kill it.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
